Keeping up with all the shotcuts when you have different devices might be challenging... 
I created this bootlogo as a quick reminder - specially if you plan to gift your Miyoo A30 device.
The image is taken from SpruceOs repo: https://github.com/spruceUI/spruceOS 
Credits where it's due.
for personal use - confirmed and working.

Instructions: 
1. Drag and drop the content of the zip in the root of your sd card
2. when prompted, merge files
3. navigate to App > BootLogo > logos > RA Shortcuts splash folder and drag it out to the BootLogo folder overwriting the existing one
4. put your sd card back to your A30 and navigate to Apps > boot logo 
That's it ! enjoy the boot logo on the next boot.
